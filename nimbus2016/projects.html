                                            MaKey MaKey is a printed circuit board with an ATMega32u4 microcontroller running Arduino Leonardo firmware. 
It uses the Human Interface Device (HID) protocol to communicate with your computer, and it can send keypresses, mouse clicks, and mouse movements.It is use by beginners and experts doing art,engineering and everything in between: using a circuit board, alligator chip and usb cable.
Team .eXe has configured a Makey-Makey to play NFS Most Wanted using an Acclerator pad, brake pad and a steering. Instead of using the conventional keypad or mouse , we uses gizmos madeup of junk, which fascinate everyone and provide them a real world experience of playing the game. Not only NFS, it can be used to play any game.

                                        On this NIMBUS Team .eXe presents a basic working prototype of registration portal for the students of NITH, which will help us a lot in the Semester Registration Process by facilitating the Fee Payment Procedure and clearing library dues. For payment register on site, login into your account and go to the option of submitting Tuition fee, do the payment using Banking card, after the successful transaction go for the payment of hostel fees followed by the library dues if any. After successful payments view and submit the form .After successful submission you will be registered for the Semester once your filled details are verified by the Department staffs and Library staff. This Registration portal will provide convenience to student and will save the time.</p>

                                        Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. Image steganography is the science of hiding secret messages inside of images.  The casual observer simply sees an ordinary image; only someone who knows how to look for it will notice or find the message.
The idea is to fiddle with each pixel's color in a way that isn't perceivable to the human eye, but that the computer can interpret. Since the human eye is least sensitive to blue wavelengths, we slightly adjust the amount of blue in each pixel in a way that encodes a single bit of information. This code is written in Java.As far as the computer is concerned, an image is just a 2-D array of pixels. The color of each pixel is encoded an integer between 0 and 16.8 million (224 - 1 to be precise), with 8 bits dedicated to each of the red, green, and blue primaries.</p>
<p>
    Flipping the ones bit of this number (i.e. subtracting 1 from an odd number or adding 1 to an even number) changes the amount of blue in the color by a minute amount that is indistinguishable to the human eye.
Hiding information: Image steganography represents the information to be hidden as a sequence of bits, and then hide that sequence of bits in the image. We will assume the information to be hidden is made up of (English) letters, digits, and punctuation marks, represented as bits according to the ASCII character set. Then, we simply set the least significant bit (LSB) of each successive pixel to 0 or 1 to match the values of each bit in your message. This will cause the blue value of each pixel to change by at most one step, which won't be noticeable; but now each pixel in the image carries one bit of your message. Since ASCII requires 7 bits to represent a single character, each character of your message will be spread across 7 pixels in the image.
Retrieving information: Someone else can then retrieve the hidden message by reading in the ones bits of each pixel. Every seven bits that you retrieve represents a single character in ASCII.
Also, since we need to be able to both hide and retrieve messages from images, we will actually write two programs, one for hiding (and encrypting) messages in images, and a program for retrieving (and decrypting) messages from images.
This project will be displayed in Central Block for three days and team members will always be present to explain and demonstate.

                                        The women safety is very important in the today's world, especially in India, government has spent thousands of crores of rupees to ensure the safety, but again the women are not so safe. We can see that, in present society the women are not safe as we expect, and the safety of women is very necessary, as there is an old saying that, the condition of any house is judged by the condition of the women in that house.

To ensure the women safety, the TEAM .eXe has taken a small step, by creating an android app related women safety and hopes that with the time, this application will be a helpful measure in women safety in future.

The use of the application is not only easy but also convinient, this application includes the emergency services. The services like the emergency RED ALERT button will once pressed will call the police at once by sending the current location of the user, and also this service does not use the internet connection, it use just GPS and sends the emergency voice call message to the police.</p>
